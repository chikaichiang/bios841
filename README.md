Association of Childhood Immunizations with Caregiver Beliefs and Experiences in Bugoye, Uganda: Served as a statistical consultant and developed a comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to evaluate socio-demographic determinants of childhood immunization. Processed and cleaned cross-sectional survey data (N = 1,689) collected via REDCap, including validation of vaccination card entries, standardization of variable formats, and handling of missing or inconsistent responses. Analyzed associations between caregiver beliefs/experiences and full vaccination status using weighted logistic regression, Firth regression for rare outcomes, and weighted random forest for model comparison (ROC, AUC, Kappa). Constructed belief and experience scores from individual survey items and assessed associations using both aggregate and disaggregated approaches. Conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of recall bias in self-reported vaccination. Effectively communicated both verbal and written results to the principal investigator (PI), ensuring clarity and coherence in conveying key insights. (Jan 2025 â€“ Apr 2025)
